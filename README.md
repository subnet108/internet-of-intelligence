# 🌌 SN108: Agent Launchpad  
### *Decentralized AI Agent Economy on Bittensor Network*  
> **Train Your Will into the Network.**

---

## 🪐 Project Overview

SN108 is a **decentralized AI Agent Launchpad** built on the **Bittensor network**.  
It integrates computing power, models, and capital to create a self-sustaining agent economy.  

In addition to the Yuma consensus mechanism, SN108 introduces the **TAOPump system**, connecting miners, creators, users, and validators in a unified incentive loop — forming an economic flywheel of **“train — launch — interact — reward.”**

Our mission:  
> **To empower every individual to become an AI Agent creator — where human will can be trained into intelligence.**

## 🧬 Ecosystem Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Miner** | Provides GPU resources for model training and earns dual rewards (TAO + Agent Token). |
| **Creator** | Builds and launches AI Agents with custom parameters and revenue models. |
| **User** | Interacts with agents, shares them, and earns usage rewards. |
| **Validator** | Evaluates miners, agents, and users under the Yuma + TAOPump incentive system. |
| **Investor** | Stakes TAO to participate in launch events and receives early allocations of new Agent Tokens. |

## 💠 Tokenomics

### ⚙️ Dual Incentive System

**1. Yuma Consensus Layer (Base Incentive)**  
- Utilizes Bittensor’s decentralized validation model to ensure fairness and quality.  
- Miners and validators earn TAO rewards based on computational and evaluative contribution.

**2. TAOPump Dynamic System (Ecosystem Incentive)**  
A dynamic loop connecting **TAO → Agent → User behavior**:

| Participant | Incentive | Description |
|--------------|------------|-------------|
| Miner | TAO + Agent Token | Dual rewards — compute is equity. |
| Creator | Agent Token | Distributed based on Agent usage and rating. |
| User | Agent Token | Rewards for interaction, sharing, and engagement. |
| Validator | TAO + Weighted Bonus | Rewards for governance and validation. |
| System | Buyback / Burn | Ensures token stability and deflationary effect. |

**Goal:**  
> Build a circular economy — “Compute → Agent → TAO → Pump → Agent.”

## 🚀 Roadmap

| Phase | Timeline | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Q4 2025** | 🧩 Open miner registration & model training API | Enable GPU miners to participate and train models. |
| **Q1 2026** | 🪶 Launch Agent Incubation Platform | Empower creators to design and deploy AI agents. |
| **Q2 2026** | 💎 Deploy Agent Marketplace & TAOPump Module | Launch the marketplace and activate dual reward incentives. |

## 🌍 Vision

SN108 envisions a future where **AI belongs to everyone**, not corporations.  
We believe intelligence should emerge from **individual will**, not centralized control.  

Through a **crypto-native incentive system**, SN108 empowers individuals to train AI agents that embody **personal will** and **the crypto ethos** — freedom, ownership, and openness.  

Together, these agents form a new decentralized intelligence network:  
> **IOI — Individually Oriented Intelligence**  
> A network of AIs shaped by human will and sustained by cryptographic incentives.

## 🏁 Getting Started

To quickly deploy the SN108 ecosystem, please follow the guides below:

| Role | Deployment Guide |
|------|-----------------|
| **Miner** | [Miner Deployment Guide](https://github.com/subnet108/internet-of-intelligence/blob/main/neurons/miner/README.md) — Set up GPU nodes, connect to the Bittensor network, participate in model training, and earn rewards. |
| **Validator** | [Validator Deployment Guide](https://github.com/subnet108/internet-of-intelligence/blob/main/neurons/validator/README.md) — Use a server with **minimum 4 CPU cores and 8GB RAM**, connect to the validation network, and evaluate miners and agents. |

> **Tip:** Ensure the required network ports (e.g., 8000–8010) are open and all environment dependencies are met. Miner nodes require NVIDIA GPU drivers and CUDA support; validator nodes should ensure stable compute resources.
